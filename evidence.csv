We’re now just a month away from Georgia’s 2022 primary election, which will be held on May 24 and will include primary races for governor, U.S. Senate, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, and more. But if you want to vote in that election, you need to make sure you’re registered today: Monday, April 25, 2022.

If you think you are registered to vote, double-check your registration on Georgia’s My Voter Page. It literally takes seconds and will let you confirm not only that you are indeed registered to vote in the state, but that your name, address, and other information is correct. Georgia has a “use it or lose it” law, so if you have not voted for five years, you will be deemed an “inactive” voter. After two general elections as an “inactive” voter, your registration is cancelled. If you are “inactive,” you can still vote, and voting will change your status to “active.”",0,Supports

I usually vote, of course. That’s what citizens do. As a registered, usually faithful, voter without a party affiliation, though, I often have one or two choices, usually local races, in primaries. Those are important, for sure. If you agree with the person who said that all politics is local, perhaps those local races are the most important. But important isn’t always the same as urgent or attention-grabbing.

This year, June 7, the primary election matters a great deal, no matter what local or statewide races are on the ballots. This primary election, a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot would significantly alter the power of the people. Specifically, it would increase the threshold vote required in some instances for citizens to make their own laws when they don’t agree with how their elected representatives are handling the task. The proposal is Amendment C, and it’s both important and urgent.",0,Supports

Already, we have one of the most restrictive laws in the country — and if Roe falls, we will have a trigger ban that eliminates access completely. When asked if they supported or opposed banning all abortions in the state if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, 54 percent of voters said no, with 42 percent strongly opposed. As for the constitutional carry law that passed last year — the one that means anyone 21 or older can carry a handgun without a license — a majority of Texans, along with many law enforcement officials, opposed it.

For a stretch last year, more Texans disapproved of Mr. Abbott than approved of him — a rarity since 2015. His rating bounced back this spring, to 47 percent approval vs. 41 percent disapproval. Republicans still like him — as of April, 80 percent approved.

And yet: If the measure of a leader is how he operates in a crisis, Mr. Abbott has failed at every turn — sometimes spectacularly, if such a thing can be said. Some examples: The freeze in February 2021 that officially killed 246 Texans, though the real toll was likely far higher, while donors to his energy company made off like bandits. His antipathy toward vaccination mandates of almost any kind while more than 88,000 Texans died of Covid. His failure to even consider that his stance against abortion in the case of rape would cause what some think of as forced births. No worries: Mr. Abbott said that his administration would “eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas.”",0,Supports

With primary election season upon us, it is apropos to talk about our Independent voters who are disenfranchised from these elections. For nearly 25 years, I have been a leading voice, unrelenting advocate, supporter and prime sponsor of bills to give voters unaffiliated with any party the right to participate in our primary elections. Membership in a political party (or the decision to avoid joining a political party) should not dictate whether a voter can vote in a primary.

For me it started in my first session in the House in 1996 with HB 2411 and has continued every session since, including this one with the introduction of SB 346 . This bill seeks to allow unaffiliated/Independent voters the ability to choose a primary to participate in, either Democratic or Republican. It looks like the persistence is paying off. Several similar bills have been introduced by colleagues on both sides of the aisle and grassroots organizations are speaking out in favor of changing our antiquated primary system.

But not all voter ID laws. Some (like the one in federal law) are flexible, to try to make sure that every eligible citizen can be identified and can vote. Others are stricter, designed in a way that will keep large swaths of the population from voting. Unfortunately, there has been a concerted effort to push strict voter ID laws this past year—an effort that has resulted in eight new laws requiring voters to show forms of ID that many Americans don't have.

More than 20 million Americans—one in 10 eligible voters—do not have the kinds of photo ID required by strict new state voter ID laws, according to research by the Brennan Center and others. Some are even harder hit: Eighteen percent of older Americans, 18 percent of citizens aged 18 to 24, and 25 percent of African-Americans don't have these kinds of photo IDs. It is wrong to pass laws that block some Americans from voting and to deny them the opportunity to participate equally in our democracy.

Ever since Evo Morales was elected President over 33 months ago, the Bolivian far-right has taken advantage of every concession, compromise and conciliatory gesture by the Morales regime to expand their political power, block even the mildest social reforms and paralyze the functioning of the government, through legal maneuvers and gangs of violent street thugs.

When Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston's names are put together in one sentence, another one usually follows: Brad Pitt. For years, the two Hollywood stars were part of a fictionalized love triangle that the tabloid media had going for some time. As many fans can recall, Aniston and Pitt pulled the plug on their marriage in 2005, which was about the same time that Pitt and Jolie were making red carpet appearances together for their film, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""

During an interview with InStyle back in 2012, Aniston admitted that she was tired of hearing so many stories about her, her ex-husband and her supposed love rival six years after her divorce. When asked about what aggravated her the most at the time, Aniston said (via Daily Mail), ""I would say the triangle with my ex-husband — and that there's a feud there. It's constant. It's a story headline that won't go away, but it's a money thing — (people make money off) a story that has nothing to do with reality.""",0,Refutes

Suddenly, everything comes to a standstill. Cars stop. Pedestrians freeze in place. The presidential convoy is approaching, looking not unlike a scene from an American action film, combined with a bit of slapstick. The SUV with tinted windows is flanked by several pickups, each with a machine gun mounted in the bed manned by masked soldiers looking like they mean business. Then there is the sniper, strapped in on the roof of a moving vehicle, peering through his scope.

Being the president of Guinea-Bissau, to be sure, is not without risk, as is apparent from the bullet holes in the façade of the government palace.

Corey Lewandowski is Donald Trump’s campaign manager,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-real-news-is-trump-is-broke,"As you can see, the news of the day is Donald Trump’s firing of war-time campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski never actually functioned as a campaign manager – more like what the modern campaign calls a body man or traveling press secretary. In recent months, Paul Manafort has, supposedly, been filling that role. So it’s not clear what effect his dismissal will have other than signaling to worried Republicans some desire for change and steadying Trump himself with an act of demonstrative dominance.

My real interest is in a different question: where’s the money?

I got onto thinking about this when I saw John McQuaid’s short piece in Forbes. As McQuaid notes, this is the gaping hole, the burning question at the center of Trump’s campaign. Reports suggest that Trump has been unwilling to undergo the ego effacement of calling high dollar Republican donors and asking for money.

Donald Trump did not support the Iraq War,https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-has-europe-stuck-behind-jcpoa/,"When the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – or the Iran nuclear deal – was first signed in 2015, it was quickly described as the first success in global diplomacy for the EU. The EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has a formal role as the Coordinator of the JCPOA’s Joint Commission, in acknowledgement of the EU doing the diplomatic heavy lifting on negotiating the deal within the P5+1 format, and with Iran. Certainly, there has long been a sense in several European capitals – especially Brussels – that Europeans have a special responsibility to preserve the deal, including by keeping it on life support as former US President Donald Trump withdrew from it. A revived JCPOA now hangs in the balance, but the Europeans are still working towards it. The decision to spend this much political capital on the JCPOA is a sign that the deal is viewed in Europe as being valuable in itself.

Europeans have long been worried that Iran’s expanding nuclear programme posed a major nuclear proliferation risk. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine led Moscow to leverage its nuclear capabilities to contain Western policies in defence of Ukraine, Europeans grew even more convinced that a nuclear-armed Iran must be avoided at all costs. Similarly worrying is the potential contagion effect of a nuclear-armed Iran on other regional powers, which would certainly have pursued equal capabilities, if not for deterrence purposes. That particular risk is even higher today, at a time when traditional deterrence mechanisms are being profoundly questioned, including as a result of the retrenchment of the US from its role as a security guarantor.

While the JCPOA was always going to be an imperfect deal, it did curtail Iran’s nuclear capabilities. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), after the JCPOA, Iran shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium, capped its level of uranium enrichment at 3.67%, removed two-thirds of its installed centrifuges, agreed to convert the Fordow enrichment plant into a research facility, and redesigned the Arak heavy water reactor. The IAEA inspectors, who had reasonably good access to Iran’s nuclear facilities, always maintained that Tehran was compliant with the JCPOA.",0,Refutes

It was against this backdrop that Barr turned to Fox News last night to brag about how “very proud” he is of the prosecutor’s work. The former attorney general added:

In all likelihood, Barr knows better.

Hillary Clinton, whether you love her or hate her, embarked on a historical presidential campaign and it appears as though she's not going away anytime soon. Hillary came onto the national scene when her husband, Bill Clinton, ran for office in the early 1990s. Ushering in a new era of youth, vitality, and internet savviness to the White House, the Clintons were seen as nothing short of a power couple who embarked on a political dynasty all their own.

""I think that people who are married to politicians are under a tremendous strain,"" Hillary said back in 1979 when Bill was serving as the governor of Arkansas, ""because unless you have a pretty strong sense of your own self-identity, it becomes very easy to be buffeted about by all the people who are around your husband"" (via BuzzFeed News).

"In Westchester, New York, the average wage is almost 10 times the national average.",https://www.thenation.com/article/society/sentencing-disparity-incarceration/,"EDITOR’S NOTE: In the fall of 2021, a group of students at Wake Forest University took part in a class on data-driven advocacy. Their objective was to find a question that was broadly relevant to inequality, answer that question using basic tools of data science, and convincingly communicate that answer clearly to a broad audience in a partnership with the Puffin Nation Fund Writing Fellowships. This article is the second of the final products that came out of that course. The authors sought to understand whether racial disparities in crime and punishment have consequences that extend beyond the legal system, including employment, income, and mental health.

A legal system capable of delivering justice fairly and equally is a cornerstone of a functioning democracy. But in the United States, some racial groups are more likely to run afoul of that system than others. Approximately 1.3 million Americans are currently incarcerated, a higher per capita rate than any other country. And while one in every 17 white men in the United States will be jailed at some point in their life, one in three Black men will suffer the same fate. Black and Hispanic men are also sentenced to longer jail terms than their white counterparts. For these reasons, Black people comprise the majority of prisoners in the United States despite being a minority in the population at large. This racial disparity is reflected in data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a survey following almost 9,000 young Americans throughout their lives starting in 1997. Survey respondents are chosen so that the sample matches the demographic characteristics of the US population. Figure 1 shows NLSY respondents and their incarceration status as of the start of the year 2017; Black people are considerably overrepresented among those who had spent time in jail.1",0,Supports

Income inequality is 0.396 in the United States,https://www.investing.com/analysis/things-just-got-real-200580368,"The big news last week was that the inflation reading from the report not only surpassed all expectations, it was the largest positive surprise on record. The headline number rose 4.2% in April from a year ago and the number (less food and energy costs) rose 3%. Most notable about all of this, perhaps, is the fact that inflation has already made up for its shortfalls last year and is now running faster than its pre-pandemic trend. Thus the recent surge is clearly more than just a result of the low base numbers from a year ago.

This would seem to validate the comments from many corporate executives lately like those from Kellogg (NYSE: ) CEO, Steve Cahillane: “We haven’t seen this type of inflation in many, many years.” More than just a statistical quirk resulting from, “base effects,” inflation has returned in way not seen in a long time. Representative of this fact is core inflation’s gain of 0.9% in April from March, the fastest monthly increase since 1982.

The Fed would like us to believe these trends are, “transitory,” and will not last more than a few months. However, as my friend Peter Atwater tweeted last week, “At the end of the day, it is far less important whether the Fed thinks inflation is transitory than whether the crowd thinks inflation is transitory.” In other words, what will actually determine whether inflation is transitory is not fedspeak but inflation expectations.",0,Supports

Although German certainly did have to compete with French for attention, the competition was a very uneven one. French had, for historical reasons, always been the first foreign language in Britain. For centuries after the Norman Conquest, Britain was characterized by French-English diglossia among the elite (even French-English-Latin triglossia) and French still had the status of a lingua franca in European court circles well into the eighteenth century (Rjéoutski, Argent & Offord 2014). I should also warn that I am a Germanist whose interest in this subject began with the history of German teaching and learning – my perspective is rather that of looking at the position of German in comparison to French, rather than an even-handed evaluation of the two. The underlying research for the detailed history of French in schools since 1850 has not yet been done .

2German first began to compete with French for prestige, at least, if not for numbers of learners, from the mid-eighteenth century onwards, as it was increasingly recognized as a literary language alongside French (for more detail on the period up to 1850 (McLelland in press 2015). Gebhard Wendeborn, Minister for the German chapel on Ludgate Hill, London, summed up the changing status of German compared to French in Europe of the 1770s in his Elements of German Grammar as follows:

The French, who in general are thought to be rather partial to their own productions, have lately begun to study the German language, and to think favourably of German literature; against which they formerly entertained great prejudices. Among the English the German has been hitherto very little known; but there is reason to expect, that within a few years, even in this country [i.e. England], so famous for the improvement and patronage of the arts and sciences, the language and the literature of the Germans will no more be looked upon with indifference.

Description: ""As the planetary system most familiar to us, the Solar System presents the best opportunity to study questions about the origin of life and how enormous complexity arise from simple physical systems in general. This module surveys the physical and dynamical properties of the Solar System. It focuses on the formation, evolution, structure, and interaction of the Sun, planets, satellites, rings, asteroids, and comets. The module applies basic physical and mathematical principles needed for the study, such as fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, orbital dynamics, solid mechanics, and elementary differential equations. However, prior knowledge in these topics is not needed, as they will be introduced as required. The module will also include discussions of very recent, exciting developments in the formation of planetary and satellite systems and extrasolar planets (planetary migration, giant impacts, and exoplanetary atmospheres).""

For the past four days millions of Britons have suffered long queues at airport check-in and some even brought pillows and duvets knowing they would be forced to sleep on terminal floors. Others passed out on baggage carousels while waiting hours for their suitcases, some of which never arrived and are still missing more than 100 hours later due to a lack of ground staff. Queues snaked around terminals at Manchester, Stansted, Birmingham, Bristol, Gatwick and Heathrow in conditions described as 'hell'. The delays also spread to Eurostar at London St Pancras today where queues for check-in and security stretched for close to half a mile.

This treatment can be done on the entire eyebrow or to fill in a just portion of an eyebrow. Beauty Insider visits Natalie Attenello, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, to see how she performs an eyebrow transplant. The first step is to mark the eyebrows to the desired shape. Then Attenello needs to obtain a strip of hair from a different body part, usually the back of the scalp, to relocate it to the eyebrow area. She separates the hair follicles and individually inserts them into the eyebrows at the correct angle and direction for the hair to grow. It takes about 200 to 300 individual follicles per eyebrow for a full transformation. Although the results are immediate, the transplanted hairs will fall out after a couple weeks, and new hair growth will start in about three months. The procedure usually ranges from $8,000 to $10,000 but can be more depending on the number of follicles needed.

Earlier this week there were reports 40-year-old Meghan was 'trying to heal four-year rift' with her estranged father, but that she was concerned about the involvement of her half-siblings Thomas Jr and Samantha, as she 'believes they have their own agendas'. And speaking to Dan Wootton, her elder sibling Thomas Jr was unrelenting in his criticism of her, saying she had not attempted to reach out to him or her father.",0,Refutes

President Obama signed an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools,https://www.kplctv.com/2022/04/22/biden-order-aims-protect-old-growth-forests-wildfire/,"SEATTLE (AP) — With a backdrop of flowering trees, it was a setting fit for the signing of major environmental legislation. Even Seattle’s notorious clouds parted as President Joe Biden stepped up to speak Friday.

The gap between the scale of the global warming crisis and the president’s initiatives seemed wider than ever on Earth Day. Although last year’s infrastructure legislation had some climate policies, such as building more charging stations for electric cars, many of Biden’s most ambitious proposals remain stalled in Congress.",0,Refutes

If ISIS or al-Qaeda or the North Koreans or someone had deliberately shut down the power and backup systems at the country’s busiest airport, we would have an outside source and an intentional action to blame. We would be discussing how to prevent the next cyber-sabotage, whether existing systems at other airports and critical infrastructure were secure enough, and how to ensure everyone knew what to do in this sort of emergency.

Instead, it appears to be the usual cascading mistakes and system failures.

Georgia Power said it believes a failure of its equipment may have started a fire that led to a massive power outage at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport causing more than 1,000 flight cancellations Sunday, disrupting flights for travelers from around the world. “While evaluation of the incident is ongoing, Georgia Power believes that a piece of Georgia Power switchgear located in an underground electrical facility could have failed and started a fire,” Georgia Power said in a written statement overnight after the power was restored. “This fire was located adjacent to redundant circuit cables and switching mechanisms serving the airport and those cables were damaged, resulting in the outage and loss of redundant service methods.” “Georgia Power’s system responded properly by isolating areas where equipment wasn’t operating correctly to ensure safety and minimize damage,” the company said. “No personnel or passengers were in danger at any time.”",0,Supports

For decades, government lawyers have claimed that respecting religious liberty in the military will cause the sky to fall. In their most recent filing, they’re back at it, asking for a blanket exemption from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on national-security grounds. But the truth is that courts have extensive experience applying RFRA to the military in ways that have permitted hundreds of religious minorities and other believers to serve their country without having to abandon their religious beliefs — all without compromising the military’s weighty national-security interests. That is just what Congress intended.

It has been said that the only law that works is the law of unintended consequences. The Navy is certain to reinforce that impression if it gets its way in the emergency proceeding it filed last week at the U.S. Supreme Court.

For decades, government lawyers have claimed that respecting religious liberty in the military will cause the sky to fall. In their most recent filing, they’re back at it, asking for a blanket exemption from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on national-security grounds. But the truth is that courts have extensive experience applying RFRA to the military in ways that have permitted hundreds of religious minorities and other believers to serve their country without having to abandon their religious beliefs — all without compromising the military’s weighty national-security interests. That is just what Congress intended. Rather than jumping in to change the standard set by Congress — which could upend decades of progress in protecting service members’ religious freedom — the Court should follow the proven track and let RFRA balancing do its work, as is already happening in the district court.",0,Refutes

Muslims did not send out missionaries to convert believers to Islam: they sent armies.

Mohammed began Islam by proclaiming himself a prophet. He supposedly received his prophecies in dreams from the Angel Gabriel. Mohammed was not literate. Mohammed orally passed on these prophecies, the suras of the Koran. Only after his death were the suras put in written form.

Mohammed was rejected by his tribe and moved out of Mecca to Medina. Initially he was well received by the Jews there, but once they rejected his prophecies, he killed them all.

Moreover, GDP is set to rise above 3 % in the medium term.

This has been thanks to Jordan's remarkably strong performance as a result of its efforts. To achieve this, the Kingdom has had to mobilise domestic revenues. In addition, like all countries globally, Jordan has had to deal with the problems generated by the pandemic. Even so, the nation has protected itself from critical health and social spending, and has been able to enact key structural reforms for its recovery.

The Romney/Ryan campaign claims that the U.S. government is the problem, and not the solution.

They claim that the U.S. budget is ""out of control"" spending, and that 47% of the people in this country are not footing their ""fair share"" for the bill of operating this great nation. They argue that we must get our fiscal house in order, and reduce spending for all this welfare and food stamps. Without addressing their claims, let us look at the lessons that we learned during the Bush Administration.

During the Bush Administration, the national debt went from roughly $5 trillion in 2000, to $14 trillion in 2008. That means the GDP more than doubled under the Bush Administration. During that same time, Bush grew government spending by 8%. Total US government spending in 2000 was $1.5 trillion. Total US government spending in 2008 was $2.9 trillion. Government spending doubled under the Bush Administration. The US Gross Domestic Product was growing at 5% in 2000. The GDP was growing at 2% in 2008, but in the eight years of the Bush presidency, the GDP went from roughly $5 trillion, to $14 trillion. When the GDP grows at such unheard of rates, a lot of new millionaires are created. How did this happen?

'He thinks he's invincible, feels he can't be hurt': Craig Richards says Joshua Buatsi will contribute to his own downfall when the rivals collide on Saturday… as 'Spider' plots revenge against Dmitry Bivol next EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY MATT DAVIES: Craig Richards (centre) and Joshua Buatsi (bottom left) go head-to-head at the O2 Arena on Saturday night in the battle to become Britain's best light-heavyweight. It's Buatsi who comes in as the favourite, having exceeded all prior expectation to win Olympic bronze in 2015 and subsequently beating all 15 of his opponents in the pro ranks to date. Richards believe the success has gone to Buatsi's head, however, which he says will be the unbeaten fighter's downfall. 'You believe you're something special,' Richards told Buatsi as they met for their face-off ahead of the eagerly-anticipated light-heavyweight domestic clash on Saturday night. 'If you don't believe you're something special, what are you doing, bro?' Buatsi responded. Two statements that perhaps perfectly encapsulate the differing journeys the two south Londoners have undertaken in their careers: Buatsi, an accomplished amateur, was picked to represent Team GB at the Olympics and has since been regarded a future Matchroom golden goose; Richards, often an underdog, has instead had to bulldoze his way into contention....read Richards wants Bivol rematch after defeating Buatsi in domestic clash

Even if you don't follow the Olympics every four years, you likely still know about Michael Phelps. Over the past two decades, he made headlines, broke records, and won the hearts of fans all over the world as one of the brightest stars from Team USA. Some of those fans even ended up competing against him toward the end of his professional swimming career. After competing at five Olympics from 2000 to 2016, Phelps retired as the most successful Olympic athlete of all time.

His career started off slow compared to other Olympic athletes. He joined a swim team in his home town of Baltimore simply because his sisters had joined, but the Atlanta 1996 Olympics lit a fire inside of him and he set his sights on the Olympics (via Biography). As an unknown at the Sydney 2000 Olympics four years later, 15-year-old Phelps went home without any medals. However, at the Athens 2004 Olympics, he went home with eight medals, six of them gold.

Introduction South Korea is one of the countries with the longest working hours in the OECD countries. Long working hours can be a risk factor of mental illness as well as cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of long working hours on depressive symptoms among employees in South Korea.

Methods This study used data from the Korea Working Conditions Survey in 2014. Study subjects included 22 910 employees aged 19 years or older who work more than 35 hours per week. Working hours were categorised into 35–40, 41–52, 53–68, and more than 68 hours per week. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the WHO’s Well-Being Index with cut-off score of 50.

On average, across OECD countries, the proportion of women in paid work is high (62%). However, women in OECD countries earn 18% less than men, only about one-third of managerial posts are held by a woman, many more women work in part-time jobs than men (25% and 6% respectively). These gender differences are even wider with the presence of children since women are more likely to adjust their employment practices upon the arrival of a child much more than men.

The USA worked more hours than the average of the OECD countries in 2014.,https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/wide-gap-in-pension-benefits-between-men-and-women.htm,"March 2020 - Data shows that across European OECD countries, pension payments to women aged 65 and over were 25% lower, on average, than for men. Differences are above 40% in Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, while in Denmark, Estonia and the Slovak Republic the pension gap is lower than 10%.

Hence, the gender gap in pensions is substantially higher than the gender pay gap at 13% on average in the OECD countries in 2017. This is because, on top of often having worked in lower paid jobs, older women are more likely to have worked part-time and to have had longer career breaks. Since pension benefits are often earnings-related, these differences in career profiles between men and women can lead to large gender disparities in pension payments. Moreover, having often spent more time caring for children or relatives over their lifetimes, older women may face difficulties in meeting contributory requirements and are therefore more likely to receive only minimum pension payments or old-age safety nets. Older women who do not receive a pension at all are not covered by the gender pension gap indicator in the Figure below.

Pension systems mitigate the transmission of lifetime earnings inequalities into pensions to differing degrees, but the real culprit is the legacy of decades of inequality in careers and earnings (Lis and Bonthuis, 2019). Even if younger women today will earn more of their pension entitlements, achieving gender equality in pensions will remain a challenge because of the persistent earnings gap and the different distribution of care tasks between parents. Pension systems are not meant to address and solve these issues and, hence, a more comprehensive approach encompassing employment, social and family policies is required to tackle the challenges faced by women and working parents.",1,Supports

Strategy Analytics analyst Susan Welsh de Grimaldo notes that “while direct mobile broadband subscriptions on tablets represent less than 10 percent of the total tablet installed base in 2012, they were a key driver of positive postpaid net additions at leading operators AT&T and Verizon Wireless in Q1 2013.” The firm’s full press release is posted below.

COVID-19 has raised the demand for high-speed, consistent broadband services in all of our everyday tasks, including learning, training, searching for news and content, and making purchases. The digitalization of our lives has resulted in an exponential increase in data utilization and a multifold increase in fixed and portable broadband demand. When we look at COVID-19-infused habits among our adolescent demographics, we believe that a large amount of this technology activity will stick around.

Broadband is a necessary element of our economic growth and progress in sociological, economical, and business districts. It has the ability to impact and affect the lives of all individuals by increasing access to high-quality resources (e.g., national healthcare, youth development, and banking) and providing job opportunities. Rural India has made significant progress in the internet over the last three years, thanks mostly to smartphone usage and affordable data prices. The anchors for continuing and increasing this growth agenda in the next innings will be broadband utilization in rural areas and mass implementation of fixed broadband.

But these incidents apart, the big picture is very different. Thanks to low sick pay – now back to pre-Covid levels despite Boris Johnson’s promise to “build back better” from the health emergency – Britain has among the fewest working days lost to illness in the developed world.

Sickness absence rose last year as the economy reopened, from a record low in 2020 when the pandemic reduced socialising and people could keep logging on from home despite illness. However, despite rising from 3.6 to 4.6 days a year, the average number of days lost to sickness has been falling steadily – from seven a year in the mid-1990s.

Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness and Serious Outcomes Flu vaccination has many benefits. It has been shown to reduce flu illnesses and also to reduce the risk of more serious flu outcomes that can result in hospitalization or even death in older people. Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.

The best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications is with a flu vaccine. CDC recommends that almost everyone 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine each year, ideally by the end of October.

The 60-year-old part-time employment judge from North London suffered catastrophic blood clots in his bowel. The condition can quickly become life-threatening, as the clots can break off and travel elsewhere in the body, stopping blood and nutrients from reaching vital organs. Within three weeks, Richard was dead.

A coroner’s report confirmed the cause: the jab triggered the clots that killed him. It must be said, such complications are vanishingly rare. Blood clots are thought to occur in just seven in every million vaccinated people, and out of 49 million Britons who have had two doses, the problem has contributed to just 24 deaths, according to data obtained from death certificates and recorded by the Office For National Statistics.
